# variables are place holder for data or are used to store data
# A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
age = 4
_age = 6


# Rules govering variables
# - Variable name cannot start with a number --> 3num = 6
# - Variable name must be very descriptive
# - Variable name can contain alpha-numeric values (A-Z,0,9) and underscore _
# - Variable name can start with underscore _ ----> _age = 6
# - Variable names case sensitive eg--- name is not same as Name and age is not same as _age


# Importance of using variables
# Without variables you will have to manually update values all the time when the need be
# But with variable you just need to change it once and it will reflect throughout your code

# Multi Words Variable Names
# Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.
# There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:

# Camel Case
motherName = 'Joy'

# Pascal Case
MotherName = 'Joy'

# Snake Case
mother_name = 'Joy'

# Some variable hacks
x = 6
y = 7
z = 8

x,y,z = 6,7,8

a = 6
b =6
c =6

a = b= c = 6


# The print function is used to output variable
print(a,b,c,sep='*****')


# Comments in python 
#This is a comment explaining the code i have written below which is just summing up two numbers
# num1 , num2 = 5,10
# result = num1 + num2
# print(result)

#types of commenting in python
# -- single line commenting 
# -- multi-line commenting
