PROJECT ONE
You are a student and you are tasked to create a program that

Your program should:
- Ask students for the number of courses they have taken for the semester
- Take the name of the courses and store them in a list
- Take the corresponding grades and store them in a list
- Print courses and their corresponding grades
- Return the average grade for the semester
- Return the highest grade obtained
- Return the lowest grade obtained
